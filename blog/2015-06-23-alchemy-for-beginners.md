On 23 June 2015 I took part in my second Pecha Kucha session, talking about one of my hobbies â€” liqueur making.

You can find the presentation [here](https://www.pechakucha.com/presentations/alchemy-for-beginners).

This was the PechaKucha "Presentation of the Day" on Thursday, September 4, 2015.
