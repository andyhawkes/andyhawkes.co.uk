You know what? I like it.

It’s a £30 gadget that doesn’t do anything I couldn’t already do with my Xbox360 hooked up to my TV and my home network, but it’s a great bit of kit - compact, easy to set up, and easy to use.

The number of apps with “cast” functionality is pretty limited at present, but I hope that it will expand substantially as the Chromecast gets more popular in the UK.

As an Android user there are some key features that are currently missing - particularly the ability to “cast” from Chrome on Android - but as a first-look at the technology I have to say that I’m impressed!
