Today I (probably) invented a new technology term: Homepathic estimation

## Homeopathic estimation

/ˌhəʊ.mi.əˈpæθ.ɪk ˌɛstɪˈmeɪʃn/

1. the process of estimating a technical task which involves an extremely small amount of evidence, knowledge, or experience that in larger amounts would actually be useful or indicative of reality.
2. the process of estimating the complexity of a task based purely on "vibes".
