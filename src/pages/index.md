# Some things from the mind of Andy Hawkes

Welcome to my very rudimentary personal website, which can probably best be described as:

> "some general guff and links from a guy who is variously: VP Product Engineering & Architecture at [Deltatre](https://www.deltatre.com/streaming-and-digital), a tinkerer / maker and breaker of things, a biker, a bespoke liqueur maker, a craft beer aficionado, and an apprentice polymath"

In other words, I am an easily distracted professional geek with no other qualifications in anything tangible or useful in the real world.

I still look vaguely like this photo, but a bit older and much more tired.

I have been creating websites and working with "the internet" in one way or another for over 30 years, and this version of my site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), because it's quick and easy.

First I did stuff on the web for fun, then I got paid to do it, and now I get paid to manage other people to do it much better than I can any more.

This website is deliberately very simple, because for me it's more about putting _something_ together rather than doing something "fancy".

So don't come at me with your shiny new frameworks and whatnot - I remember browsing the web (such as it was) via a green-screen terminal at university using [Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)) as my browser, and am a certified veteran of the [Browser Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars), so this will do just fine for me (for now).

At it's heart, this site is a vague attempt to bring together some of the various things I have done, thought about, or written over the years.

The [blog](blog) pulls together some of the assorted thoughts and "blog type things" I have put online via various tools and platforms over many years — I have tracked down some stuff back to 2009 so far — with varying degrees of success and/or longevity.

<!-- The [writing](writing) section is an attempt to get some of the longer ideas that have been bouncing round my head down in writing in some form. Some of it might be interesting to people who aren't me. Some of it probably isn't. But it's here anyway - hurray for the internet! -->

All opinions are my own (or shamelessly stolen).
