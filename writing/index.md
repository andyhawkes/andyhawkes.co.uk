Sometimes I write things.

Here are some of those things.


- [The Ultimatum](/writing/the-ultimatum/) - A fictional series of thoughts, scenes, and stories following on from a singular event in human history.

- [The man who forgot himself](/writing/the-man-who-forgot-himself/) - A series of thoughts and observations relating to what I am coming to realise is my own particular form of neuro-divergence.
