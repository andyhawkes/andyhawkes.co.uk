# The idea

I had a story idea many years ago, and have failed to turn it into anything yet.

So now I'm trying to turn it into something.

The idea is simple - at a single point in time, every single human being receives exactly the same message, and nobody knows how or why. What does it mean, and how does humanity react to it?

# The format

What from will this project take? Who knows!

If you've read any of the stuff in ["The man who forgot himself"](/writing/the-man-who-forgot-himself), you will know that my brain works in atypical ways, so I have some disjointed ideas that span prose, screenwriting, and comic book formats.

So basically, let's see what it becomes!

# The Ultimatum

> Humanity is being observed.  
You have achieved astounding things.  
Yet you continue to do terrible things to each other and to your planetary home.  
As your presence expands beyond the bounds of your planet's gravity, your future must be decided.  
The lives of every human are very different, with great inequality being experienced across your planet.  
The fate of your species will be determined based on the life of just one of you.  
Your representative has been chosen.  
The judgement begins now.
