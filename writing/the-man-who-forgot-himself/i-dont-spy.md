# I don't spy with no mind's eye...

So, I have [aphantasia](https://aphantasia.com/what-is-aphantasia/).

I only realised this relatively recently — I'm closing in on my 50th birhtday in a few months time as I write this, so 2 years ago is "recent" in the grand scheme of things — when I listened to [an episode of the Curious Cases podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001gwys) from the BBC.

For anyone who doesn't know, Aphantasia is (very broadly) the inability to visualize.

What does that mean?

Let me put it this way: if I say to you "think of an apple", what do you **see**?

Does an image of an apple come to mind? What color is it? Is it whole? Is there a big bite taken out of it? Is it just floating there in front of you? Is it a 2D "picture" of an apple, or is it just like a real, freshly picked apple delivered to you by your brain alone?

For most people, a lifelike image of an apple appears in their "mind’s eye". For others, it's a vague or incomplete picture that takes time and effort to conjur up.

For me, it's nothing. Zip. Nada.

At the most basic level, people with aphantasia can’t create mental images — not of familiar objects, people, or places, not for thoughts, memories, or images of the future.

It's a bit of an odd sensation to discover that your brain works in a very specifically different way from other people — after all, we normally (and somewhat arrogantly) assume that our experience of the world is "normal" and shared by everyone else.

I had always assumed that people were being metaphorical when they said things like "picture in your mind's eye..." or "visualise a calm place...", but no, apparently some people can actually summon up visual images in their minds on command!

Aparently "normal" people spend a lot of their time hallucinating. Weird!

In fact it turns out that there is a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't work in the usual way in my brain, and I have *multisensory aphantasia*, which affects around 25% of people with aphantasia.

Fundamentally I have a "factual memory" — I remember data but I cannot "re-experience" anything from a sensory or even emotional perspective — I can't recall sights, sounds, smells, flavours, or tactile sensation, but I can tell you exactly where a specific item is in a cupboard because I "just know" where it is rather than being able to "see" it.
